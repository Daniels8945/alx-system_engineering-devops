0. Hello World : A script that prints Hello, World, followed by a new line to the standard output.
1. Confused smiley : A script that displays a confused smiley: "(Ã”o)'.
2. Let's display a file : A script that displays the content of the /etc/passwd file.
3. What about 2? : A scipt that displays content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.
4. Last lines of a file : A script that displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd.
5. I'd prefer the first ones actually : A scipt that displays the first 10 lines of etc/passwd.
6. Line #2 : A script that displays the third line of the file iacta.
The file iacta will be in the working directory and you are not allowed to use sed.
7. It is a good file that cuts iron without making a noise : A script that creates a file named exactly \*\\'"Holberton School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:) containing the text Holberton School ending by a new line.
For this challenge, remember to use a single backslash \ to escape special characters and double backslash \\ to escape the backslash itself.
8. Save current state of directory : A script that writes into the file ls_cwd_content the result of the command ls -la. If the file ls_cwd_content already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file ls_cwd_contentdoes not exist, create it.
9. Duplicate last line : A script that duplicates the last line of the file iacta.
10. No more javascript : A script that deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all its subfolders.
